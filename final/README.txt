Create an application which integrates at least TWO APIs (you may use one which we've covered in class, but the other one must be an API we did not do as an in-class example or exercise).

Github: get user info
Echarts: show user data
Google Map: show user position

You can earn bonus marks if you:

integrate three APIs instead of two
consume at least one open data source
Keep in mind that the APIs and open data sources should still come together as a cohesive concept. Don't just connect to random APIs just to earn bonus marks because those won't count.

First steps: Take a look at available APIs and see if you can come up with cohesive concept which uses at least two. This means that your website should not be random API integrations. Instead, try to see if you can make a useful website and use the APIs to supplement your code for better functionality.

You may use PHP or .NET, but whichever language you use, be sure to use best practices (i.e classes, data encapsulation, etc.) and make sure your website/page is styled. It should feel complete.

To ensure that I can view a working example, if you can, upload your project to your server so that I can see a live, working example.  Include the URL and any other info I may need in a README text file, such as a login (if applicable), so that I can use/test your site.  If you don't manage to get your project live on time, I'll still try to run your code locally, but having a live example ensures there are no API integration issues.

Make sure you include in your submission (in a ZIP file):

all code files
a README text file containing the live URL and any other info required to test out your work (if applicable)
You will be marked on:

API integration (20)
Code quality (10)
Design (10)
Creativity/Concept (5)
Cohesiveness (5)
